# EAS walk

- expo init
- eas init (updates app.json)
- eas build:configure (generates eas.json)

## EAS JSON

- added APP_ENV to test envs later
- created a "local" profile that will produce a build for the emulators ios and build an apk vs aab for Android. (Drag n drop to emulators - hit link for device)

**UH OH!!!**
Got the `babygroot.app` file but when running

```sh
No bundle URL present.
Make sure youre running a packager server or have included a .jsbundle file in your application bundle.
```

Make sure Metro is running: `yarn start` Then start the app from the simulator

### Local Android

- This actually threw an error for `expo-dev-client` out the gate. Probably the issue with needing metro for ios as well.
Not the focus of this Repo... Moving on.
