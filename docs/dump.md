# Next Steps... TO THE APP STORE

### TODO FOR ANDROID

### IOS

- TestFlight 101
- Create a Test Group (INTERNAL)
- Alpha VS Production (use case for both)
- BuildNumber vs Versioning
- Another look at app.config.js
- Repeat -- Lets create yet another Profile/Variant
- Entitlements in XCode
  - Wha? My apps not entitled
- Build (Don't Submit)
- See the different Prompts for Certs
- See the difference in EXPO
- EAS Submit (Terminal)
- Seeing your app in TestFlight
- Managing Builds to Groups
- Auto approving the "yes, no, no, Just let me test please" prompts (TODO)
- Downloading TestFlight
- Getting the App Invite
- Test Drive your app

Now you have 3 App Variants:

- Dev (Debug build)
- Preview (Release build via Expo)
- Alpha (Release build from TestFlight)

Lets get our final Profile set for Production!

... rinse repeat -- build -- test (TODO for Android)

- so that was an internal build... Lets get this ready for the AppStore!
