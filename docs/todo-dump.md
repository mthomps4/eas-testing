# TODOs

## All things ANDROID

There are multiple places where we branch off for Android specifics

- Build Variants
- Stores
- ...

## AppStore Notes

- TestFlight 101
- Create a Test Group (INTERNAL)
- Alpha VS Production Builds (Pro/Con -- use case for both)
- BuildNumber vs Versioning
- Another look at app.config.js (versioning)
- Entitlements in XCode - Double check that schema

### Build vs Submit

- EAS Build (ONLY)
  - Note the different Prompts for Certs
  - Note certs in Developer center
  - Note the difference in EXPO
- EAS Submit (Terminal)
- Seeing your app in TestFlight
- Managing Builds to Groups
- --auto-Submit
- Downloading TestFlight
- Manual/Auto approving the "yes, no, no, Just let me test please" prompts (TODO)
- Getting the App Invite
- Test Drive your app

## ADD ENVS W/ Doppler

TODO: [doppler envs with expo](doppler-envs-w-expo.md)

## Now lets set CI/CD

Conversations are needed.

- Versioning
- CI/CD
- GitHub Action
- Auto Versioning instead of manual commits
- iOS/Android
- What to expect (What/When)
