# Building w/ EAS

So we have "Hello World" running. Great!

The reality, our work means little if we can't "ship it".

So before we go crazy trying to add the coolest features into our mobile app, we need to understand how the mobile world works when it comes to building, testing, and App Submission.

If you are coming over from Web now is the time to go grab a snack, and fresh drink (or two). We're need to cover a lot of terms and process.

There are two major players in the mobile space world. Apple and Android. There are technically others (Windows, Linux, etc), and yes React Native _can_ support them, but its rare we need them.

So for this guide we are going to chat through how to `submit` with EAS to both Expo TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play (Android).

... But before we even make it to the stores, we need a `build` of our app.
