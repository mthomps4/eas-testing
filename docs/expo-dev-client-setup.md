# Expo Dev Client Setup and Notes

Once the application is installed, you'll see a menu looking for the client.
You'll need to run `expo start --dev-client --scheme myScheme` and tell the app to use the running client. Once synced you can make any JS related changes and hot reload and debug away. (see images below)
